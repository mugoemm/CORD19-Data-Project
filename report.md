# ðŸ“Š CORD-19 Dataset Analysis â€“ Final Report

## 1. Data Overview
- Dataset size: 518429 rows, 17 columns
- Key fields explored: title, abstract, publish_time, journal, source_x

## 2. Cleaning & Preparation
- Extracted `year` from `publish_time`
- Added `abstract_word_count`
- Saved cleaned dataset as `cleaned_cord19.csv`

## 3. Descriptive Statistics
- **Papers per Year:** Strong increase after 2020 due to COVID-19.
- **Top Journals:** bioRxiv, PLoS One, Sci Rep among most frequent.
- **Top Sources:** Medline, PMC, WHO collections.

## 4. Text Mining on Abstracts
- Preprocessed abstracts (lowercased, stopwords removed).
- Word frequency analysis highlighted key terms (e.g., "covid", "patients", "virus").
- WordCloud showed major research themes visually.

## 5. Topic Modeling (LDA)
- Extracted thematic clusters from abstracts.
- Topics included:
  - Clinical research and patients
  - Public health and epidemiology
  - Virology and molecular studies
  - Vaccination and immunity
  - Global impact and policy

## 6. Key Insights
- **COVID-19 drove a massive publication spike starting 2020.**
- **Preprints (bioRxiv, medRxiv) were crucial early sources.**
- **Research covered clinical, public health, and biological aspects.**
- **WordCloud + LDA confirm diverse but COVID-focused themes.**

## âœ… Conclusion
The CORD-19 dataset provides an invaluable resource for tracking
the scientific response to COVID-19. Our analysis combined data
cleaning, exploratory analysis, and text mining to uncover trends
and themes in global research output.
